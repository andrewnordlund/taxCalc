# Investment Tax Calculator

**NOT FOR OFFICIAL USE - FOR GUESTIMATES ONLY**

This calculator allows you to see the tax implications of certain types of investments in certain kinds of accounts.

For example, if you make $50,000/year now, and you expect to have an annual pension of $24,000/year in retirement, and you find ourself with $5500 money to invest today: should you put it in an RRSP, a TFSA, or leave it unregistered?  This calculator should help you make that decision based on the tax implications.

This should only be used as a general proof-of-concept.  I am _not_ a tax professional; just a nerd with a passing interest in Personal Finance.
